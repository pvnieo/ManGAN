# ManGAN
Automatic Manga colorization using Generative Adversarial Networks.

This project aims to color manga using GANs. For the moment, two types of GANs have been tested: [pix2pix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf) and [cycle-gan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf).
In this repo, we implemented cycle-gan in pytorch.

Some of the results obtained are displayed in the following image:

This project is **under development**, currently, there are diffuclties to color images containing text.

Installation instructions will be updated soon as well as our learned weights for the Death Note anime.
